# File Storage

Both Roar and Roar Collab offer several file storage options for users, each with their own quotas and data retention policies. The multiple options are available for users to optimize their workflows.


## Storage Information

| Storage | Location | Space Quota | Files Quota | Backup Policy |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Home | /storage/home | 16 GB | 500,000 files | Daily snapshot |
| Work | /storage/work | 128 GB | 1 million files | Daily snapshot |
| Scratch | /gpfs/scratch (Roar)<br>/scratch (RC) | None | 1 million files | No Backup, Files purged after 30 days |
| Group | /gpfs/group (Roar)<br>/storage/group (RC) | Allocation-dependent | Allocation-dependent | Daily snapshot |


## Check Usage

To check storage usage against the storage quotas, run the following command on either Roar or Roar Collab:
```
$ check_aci_storage_quota
```

On Roar Collab, the following command works as well:
```
$ check_storage_quotas
```

The ouputs generated by these scripts are not generated in real-time, but the underlying quota information is updated several times per day. If you remove many files, for instance, the updates to your usage will not be reflected in the outputs until the next update period. For a real-time look into your memory usage for a particular storage location, navigate to the storage location and run the following command:
```
$ du -sch .[!.]* * | sort -h
```

For a real-time look into the number of files in a storage location, use the following command instead:
```
$ find <storage_location> -type f | wc -l
```
