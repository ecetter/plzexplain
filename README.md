This repository is a personal knowledge base for the usage of ICDS systems. It contains instructional materials and notes on topics related to operating in ICDS environments for the general user. Hopefully this resource will provide assistance to the ICDS community so the ICDS userbase can have all the tools necessary to continue to conduct elite research on our high-performance computing systems.

Please feel free to reach out to me at emery [at] psu [dot] edu to request any specific topics that you would like added to the knowledge base.
